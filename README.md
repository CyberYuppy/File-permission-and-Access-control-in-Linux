# File-permission-and-Access-control-in-Linux

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to audit and update file and directory permissions within the projects directory at my organization. The existing permissions did not align with the intended access controls, posing a potential security risk. This project aimed to ensure that sensitive files and folders were properly secured by applying appropriate permission settings. To achieve this, I carried out a systematic review and implemented necessary changes to enforce proper access levels
